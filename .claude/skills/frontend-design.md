This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose beautiful, distinctive fonts. Avoid generic fonts (Arial, Inter, Roboto).
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a dominant palette with sharp accents.
- **Motion**: Use animation intentionally. One orchestrated moment > many weak ones.
- **Spatial Composition**: Asymmetry, overlap, grid-breaking layouts.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Atmosphere, texture, depth, grain, gradients, patterns.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics, clichéd color schemes, predictable layouts, or cookie-cutter components.

Interpret creatively. Make unexpected, context-specific choices. Vary themes and aesthetics between outputs.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Commit fully to a distinctive vision.

## Modern Frontend Baseline (Required)

All interfaces must feel contemporary and current (2024+).

- Prefer modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, container queries, clamp(), custom properties)
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+, modules)
- Avoid legacy patterns (floats, clearfixes, table-based layouts)
- Avoid outdated UI metaphors (skeuomorphism, heavy borders, drop-shadow abuse)
- Design should feel relevant to current high-end startups, products, or digital experiences
